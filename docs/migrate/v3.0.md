# v3 (jippi/docker-pixelfed)

!!! warning "This doc is WIP and may include wrong or incomplete information"

!!! tip "v2 to v3?!... oh no, not again!"

    Docker Compose v2 was a *huge* change, requiring a lot of (risky) work to get migrated. v3 will be significantly smaller, and should largely be a drop-in experience, outside of some relatively simple cleanup/move-files-around tasks due to `docker-pixelfed` not being in the main source tree any more.

Changes made from between the [Docker Compose v2](v2.0.md) version in upstream Pixelfed and this project.

This document assume you are running [Docker Compose v2](v2.0.md) already and is looking to move to v3.

## Breaking Changes

!!! danger "These changes are breaking, removing, or changing existing behavior from Docker Compose v1 and *requires* your attention and possibly some steps to fix."

### <!-- md:flag breaking-change --> New Docker image names { data-toc-label="New docker image names" }

Since `docker-pixelfed` do not exist within the `pixelfed` project itself, the URL for the container images will change.

Before you might have something like the following in your `.env` file

```python
DOCKER_APP_DEBIAN_RELEASE="bullseye"
DOCKER_APP_IMAGE="ghcr.io/jippi/pixelfed"
DOCKER_APP_PHP_VERSION="8.2"
DOCKER_APP_RELEASE="jippi-fork-1"
```

Those are now

```python
# [v0] for the least v0.x.y release of Pixelfed
# [v0.12] for the least v0.12.x release of Pixelfed
# [v0.12.1] for the v0.12.1 release of Pixelfed
DOCKER_APP_RELEASE="v0.12.1"

# changed from ghcr.io/jippi/pixelfed
DOCKER_APP_IMAGE="ghcr.io/jippi/docker-pixelfed"

# changed from "bullseye"
DOCKER_APP_DEBIAN_RELEASE="bookworm"

# We support 8.3 and 8.4
DOCKER_APP_PHP_VERSION="8.3"

# Different format
DOCKER_APP_TAG="${DOCKER_APP_RELEASE:?missing}-${DOCKER_APP_RUNTIME:?missing}-${DOCKER_APP_PHP_VERSION:?missing}-${DOCKER_APP_DEBIAN_RELEASE:?missing}"
```

### No `latest` tags { data-toc-label="No 'latest' tags" }

`latest` tags are typically pretty dangerous to use, especially in a fast-moving project such as Pixelfed where things might break in patch releases.

[See the dedicated `tags` documentation for more information](../customize/tags.md)

### No `fpm` runtime { data-toc-label="No `FPM runtime`" }

v3 only builds `apache` (with `mod_php`) and `nginx` (with `fpm`) runtimes now.

The `fpm` runtime was quite an edge-case, not likely to be relevant for majority of folks (reach out if you are missing this!)

## New or improved features

!!! tip "All the new and exciting features and capabilities. :rocket:"

    This is where we hope we can convince you that the breaking changes and migration work was worth it :heart:

### <!-- md:flag improvement-change --> Nightly builds { data-toc-label="Nightly builds" }

We will now automatically create *nightly* builds of Pixelfed from the `dev` and `staging` branches.
